This plugin is based a fork of carter's mephisto_tinymce (http://github.com/carter/mephisto_tinymce).

It turns the textarea fields on Mephisto's article edit pages into a rich text editor powered by TinyMCE (http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/)

To install this plugin, just like a regular Rails plugin:

script/plugin install git://github.com/tigrish/mephisto_tinymce.git
